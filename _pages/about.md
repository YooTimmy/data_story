### About Me

My name is Tian Jie, I am from China and have been living in Singapore since 2011.
I obtained both my Bachelor and Master Degree in NUS, major in Electrical Engineering and Data Analytics respectively.
I was trained as an Electrical Engineer, but now I enjoy more on delivering business insights via data analytics.

### About this Blog

This blog servers as a place for me to document down my learnings along the way, mostly in the domain of data analytics.
